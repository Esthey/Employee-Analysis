## Unveiling Insights: Analyzing Employee Data Using SQL

In today's competitive business landscape, companies increasingly recognize the significance of data-driven decision-making across all operations. One crucial area where data analysis plays a pivotal role is in understanding and managing the workforce. Analyzing employee data provides invaluable insights that can drive strategic HR decisions, optimize organizational performance, and foster a positive workplace culture.
The dataset was transformed into a CSV file and then loaded into SQL Server for analysis.

Why SQL?
SQL allows analysts to retrieve and manipulate data stored in relational databases efficiently. With SQL queries, analysts can extract specific subsets of employee data based on criteria such as department, tenure, performance metrics, and more. This capability enables targeted analysis and provides insights into various aspects of the workforce.
## Here is the Analysis objectives in detail

#### Demographic Analysis:

a. How many employees are there in the dataset, categorized by gender?
b. What is the distribution of age groups (Young, Mid-aged, Senior) among employees?
c. Can you categorize employees by their ethnicity into 'Asian', 'Black', 'Caucasian', 'Latino', and 'Other'?


#### Salary Analysis:

a. Can you categorize employees by their salary range: 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High'?
b. Determine the average salary for each job title, categorizing them into 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High' based on salary.


#### Tenure Analysis:

a. Categorize employees by their tenure with the company: 'Less than 5 years', '5 to 10 years', and 'More than 10 years'.
b. Determine the average tenure for each job title, categorized into 'Short', 'Medium', and 'Long' tenures.


#### Departmental Analysis:

a. Categorize employees by their department and determine the average age for each department.
b. Identify the department with the highest average salary, categorizing them into 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High' based on salary.


#### Performance Analysis:

b. Determine the average salary for each ethnicity-age group combination.

#### All questions were solved, and retrieved data using various SQL Queries,I then transfer the result table into Excel for more analysis 
Queries used to perform this analysis with the interpretation is found in the text document attached to this repository post.
